Thanks for purchasing my models!

Short notes.

Models consist of 5 base moodels, with 3 body materials each, and 10 Clothes materials.
There are two variants of each mesh, one is with two parts, Body and Clothes,
Second is with model broken to Body Parts for dismemberment systems.

Prefabs included are:

ShirtlessZombie_OneMesh - One mesh variant prefab, which has all the 5 meshes inside and a customization script where you can customize it in the editor.

ShirtlessZombie_BodyParts_V1 - V5 -Body Parts version of the prefab, these are individual for each mesh variant, V1 to V5, they have different Customization Script.

Included are two Instantiate scripts, One mesh and Body Parts, that can be attached to and empty GameObject to spawn a customized zombie.

Models have Open Mouth and Angry Blend shapes.
On OneMesh variants it is on the Body, on BodyParts is on the Head objects.

OneMesh variants have also 3 LOD levels, 100%, 50% and 25%

In the One Mesh/Individual Meshes folder, I`ve included also the separate One Mesh fbx files for each variant.
